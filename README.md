# HackZurich2022_LIT

The repository contains the code required to obtain the 3D point clouds from a set of 2D floorplans.

The dataset needs to be a set of 2D floorplans in png format. We have used the following website to convert pdf to png: https://pdf2png.com/

After obtaining the 3d pointclouds, we used cloudcompare to showcase our results.

Some of the data is already present.

This is just part of the pipeline. The work we did with the 3d model can be seen here: https://github.com/pneug/lit
